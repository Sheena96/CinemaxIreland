Description of Functionality:

-Fist screen is a simple splash screen containing an "enter" button.
-Once this button is clicked the user is redirected to the "whats on" screen. This screen just contains a grid view of movie
posters. There is no other functionality on this screen yet.
- In the action bar at the top there is a menu, from here the user can navigate to the "cinema" screen. Here there will be a 
list view of CinemaxIreland cinemas. 
-Using the menu again, the user can navigate to the "book tickets" screen. Here they can select which payment method they will
use and using a number picker, select the amount of tickets they wish to book. (min. one ticket, max. six tickets). They can 
also select the date that they wish to go to the cinema. (I have trouble setting a min and max date however).
- At the bottom of this screen there is a "book" button. This button should redirect the user to an "overview" screen where
they can see and overview of their booking before they make their purchase. However, I had trouble getting this "overview" 
screen to run and so the user input could not be displayed. For now I resolved this by having the user input display in the 
Android Monitor log until I can resolve the issue. 

Persistence Approach:
-For this assignment my persistence approach was to use an Array Adapter to display the data entered by the user in the "book
ticket" screen. As I have unresolved issues with my "overview" screen displaying, the data could not be displayed on the 
"overview" screen like I had planned. 
-Instead I used the log in the Android Monitor to display the user input for now. 

GIT:

UX/DX Approach:
-My UX approach was to keep the app as simple as possible with almost all navigation accessible from the menu.
-I included a "home" menu item that is accessible on every screen so that the user can return to the splash screen if they
so wish. 
- My plan for the "whats on" screen is for the user to be able to click on a movie thumbnail that they are interested in and
have information about the movie display to the user. From here I want the user to be able to then book that movie.
